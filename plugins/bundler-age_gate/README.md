# Bundler::AgeGate

A Bundler plugin that enforces minimum gem age requirements by checking your `Gemfile.lock` against the RubyGems API.

## Why?

Freshly released gems may contain bugs or security vulnerabilities that haven't been discovered yet. This plugin helps you implement a "waiting period" policy before adopting new gem versions in production environments.

## Installation

Install the plugin:

```bash
bundle plugin install bundler-age_gate
```

Or add it to your project's plugin list:

```bash
bundle plugin install bundler-age_gate --local_git=/path/to/bundler-age_gate
```

## Usage

Check that all gems in your `Gemfile.lock` are at least 7 days old:

```bash
bundle age_check
```

Specify a custom minimum age (in days):

```bash
bundle age_check 14
```

Check for 30-day minimum:

```bash
bundle age_check 30
```

Clean up exceptions that are no longer needed:

```bash
bundle age_gate_cleanup
```

This command removes exceptions for gems that are now old enough to pass the age gate without an exception.

Example output:
```
🔍 Checking 3 exception(s) for cleanup...

✅ rails (7.1.3.1) - Released 15 days ago (7 days required) - Removing
⏳ activerecord (7.1.4) - Released 3 days ago (7 days required) - Keeping
⚠️  custom-gem (1.0.0) - Not in Gemfile.lock (keeping exception)

✅ Removed 1 exception(s) from .bundler-age-gate.yml
📝 2 exception(s) remaining
```

## Configuration

Create a `.bundler-age-gate.yml` file in your project root to customise behaviour:

```yaml
# Minimum age in days (default: 7)
minimum_age_days: 7

# Audit log path (default: .bundler-age-gate.log)
audit_log_path: .bundler-age-gate.log

# Approved exceptions
exceptions:
  - gem: rails
    version: 7.1.3.1
    reason: "Critical security patch for CVE-2024-12345"
    approved_by: security-team
    expires: 2026-02-15
```

### Exception Workflow

1. Developer encounters age gate violation
2. Request exception approval (security team, staff engineer, etc.)
3. Add approved exception to `.bundler-age-gate.yml`
4. Include reason, approver, and expiry date
5. Commit configuration with approval documented

**Exception fields:**
- `gem` (required): Gem name
- `version` (optional): Specific version, omit for all versions
- `reason` (required): Explanation for exception
- `approved_by` (required): Who approved this
- `expires` (optional): Expiry date (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Audit Logging

All checks are logged to `.bundler-age-gate.log` in JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-22T13:45:00Z",
  "result": "pass",
  "violations_count": 0,
  "checked_gems_count": 80,
  "exceptions_used": 1,
  "violations": []
}
```

**Compliance benefits:**
- Track all security checks
- Audit exception usage
- Demonstrate policy compliance
- Investigate historical violations

### Multi-Source Support

Configure different age requirements for different gem sources (public vs private):

```yaml
minimum_age_days: 7  # Global default

sources:
  # Public RubyGems - strict
  - name: rubygems
    url: https://rubygems.org
    api_endpoint: https://rubygems.org/api/v1/versions/%s.json
    minimum_age_days: 7

  # Internal GitHub Packages - less strict
  - name: github-internal
    url: https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/your-org
    api_endpoint: https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/your-org/api/v1/versions/%s.json
    minimum_age_days: 3
    auth_token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}  # Environment variable

  # Internal Artifactory - very permissive
  - name: artifactory
    url: https://artifactory.company.com/api/gems
    api_endpoint: https://artifactory.company.com/api/gems/api/v1/versions/%s.json
    minimum_age_days: 1
    auth_token: ${ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY}
```

**Benefits:**
- Stricter requirements for public gems (supply chain risk)
- Permissive for internal gems (trusted sources)
- Per-source API endpoints for private registries
- Authentication support via environment variables
- CLI override still applies globally: `bundle age_check 14` enforces 14 days for ALL sources

**How it works:**
1. Plugin reads `Gemfile.lock` to determine each gem's source
2. Applies per-source minimum age requirements
3. Queries appropriate API endpoint with authentication
4. Reports violations with source context

## How It Works

1. Parses your `Gemfile.lock` using Bundler's built-in parser
2. Queries the RubyGems API for each gem's release date
3. Compares the release date against your specified minimum age
4. Reports any violations and exits with status code 1 if violations are found

**Note:** Currently only supports rubygems.org. Private gem servers or GitHub packages are not yet supported. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for planned features.

## Features

- **Efficient API usage**: Caches API responses to avoid duplicate requests
- **Progress indicator**: Prints a dot for each gem checked
- **Clear output**: Shows violating gems with release dates and age
- **Graceful error handling**: Skips gems that can't be checked (API errors, network issues)
- **CI-friendly**: Returns appropriate exit codes (0 for pass, 1 for fail)
- **Configuration file**: Customise settings via `.bundler-age-gate.yml`
- **Exception handling**: Approve specific gems with documented reasons
- **Audit logging**: Compliance-ready logs for all checks
- **Enterprise-ready**: Designed for organisation-wide rollout

## Performance

Parallel gem checking with configurable concurrency (default: 8 workers).

Configure via `.bundler-age-gate.yml`:
```yaml
max_workers: 8  # Recommended for most projects (range: 1-16)
```

Set `max_workers: 1` to disable parallelisation if needed.

## Example Output

```
🔍 Checking gem ages (minimum: 7 days)...
📅 Cutoff date: 2026-01-15

Checking 143 gems...
Progress: ...............................................

⚠️  Found 2 gem(s) younger than 7 days:

  ❌ rails (7.1.3)
     Released: 2026-01-20 (2 days ago)

  ❌ activerecord (7.1.3)
     Released: 2026-01-20 (2 days ago)

⛔ Age gate check FAILED
```

## Use Cases

- **Production deployments**: Ensure stability by waiting for community feedback
- **Security compliance**: Enforce policies requiring "battle-tested" versions
- **CI pipelines**: Add as a check in your continuous integration workflow
- **Risk management**: Reduce exposure to zero-day vulnerabilities in new releases
