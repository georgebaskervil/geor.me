# Security Policy

## Commitment

I take the security of this project very seriously.
While it might not be immediately apparent how a vulnerability could impact a DNS filterlist, it's prudent to recognize that no system is completely secure.
Thus, I remain fully committed to maintaining the security of users and encourage the responsible reporting of any potential vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

Maintaining the security of this project is my top priority. Currently, support and attention to security concerns are provided for the following version:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you uncover a potential security issue, I earnestly request your assistance in reporting it through responsible channels.
I am in the process of implementing a more robust and secure reporting system. More details will be provided once this system is in place.

### Contact Channels

**Tertiary (Social Media):**

- I can also be reached quickly on **X [@georgebaskervil](https://x.com/georgebaskervil)**:
  Note: X offers an encrypted DMs feature for premium subsribers, which is better than regular DMs for enhanced privacy.
  However, it's important to be aware that the platform's implementation of end-to-end encryption for DMs has been noted to have some flaws.
